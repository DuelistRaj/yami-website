                        would face within the game Yami. Our concept artists and pixel artists have been hard at work to
                        fine-tune the design and movements of our characters, in order to obtain the best experience for
                        players and streamline gameplay. Pictured below are some of our more current designs for Yuyo
                        and Yuki. (Images may be altered prior to release). Yuki is the elder brother and has a purple
                        skin tone, whereas Yuyo has a blue skin tone.

                    <div class="excerpt">As Yuyo and Yuki’s ancestors fled the fallen Empire, evil was always one step
                        behind. When they finally arrived at what is now Kinfallen Forest, there they found themselves
                        surrounded by dangerous creatures and former citizens of the Empire now tainted and corrupted.
                        One alone of the survivors was strong enough to take on these foes while also allowing the
                        others to escape to safety beyond. She had been part of General Stonefast’s elite squad of
                        soldiers, and her powerful and pure Yami magic held the evil at bay, and sealed away Malflessia,
                        the root of all evil within the forest. But as always happens with time, the memory of this
                        champion was eventually lost, yet the Forgotten Defender remains a constant presence. Until she
                        is unable to hold back Malflessia any longer.

                        climates and immense gravity upon its surface. Raum has four moons, and orbits two suns at the
                        center of its solar system. Below is a brief description of each of the heavenly bodies players
                        will spot in the sky during their gameplay, as well as concept art produced by Tumultuous
                        Productions’ talented artists!

                        forest. It carries its belongings in an overstuffed satchel upon its back, clinging to the past
                        memories these items possess. When spotted, they will back away and only attack when threatened,
                        but will become emboldened when other members of its kind are nearby.

                        along the forest floor, attacking any nearby threat by shooting seedpods or attempting a pitiful
                        attack. When cornered, it will usually either burrow itself underground or flee.
