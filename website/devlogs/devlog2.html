                <h2>Weekly Updates Week 2: Concepts of Creatures within Kinfallen Forest
                </h2>
                <p>Here is a showcase of two enemies you will encounter in the Kinfallen Forest, including a brief
                    description and concept art created by our talented artists: </p>
                <p>Shrubble:This small creature resembles the plant-life of Kinfallen Forest, and scurries along the
                    forest floor, attacking any nearby threat by shooting seedpods or attempting a pitiful attack. When
                    cornered, it will usually either burrow itself underground or flee.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">(Yuki and Yuyo)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Tresswing: This aerial creature only has two wings and a beaked face, and flies amongst the canopy of
                    the forest. When spotting an unsuspecting wanderer, it will swoop down to peck at any unlucky
                    traveler’s head.</p>

                <h3>Weekly Member Spotlight:</h3>
                <p>For this week, we asked our Lead Composer for all Yami sounds and music, Sassykeys, a few questions
                    to provide an insight into his creative process.</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What originally inspired/brought you into pursuing and learning music?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span> “As early as I can remember there was a piano in my house. I used to enjoy sitting down and
                    smashing some keys - even if the notes didn't make sense I still enjoyed it. So I think a natural
                    interest at an early age really helped.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What led you to want to create music for a video game?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“I had been doing session jobs for a while, but felt something was missing. My main time spent on
                    piano has always been composition. I don't actually know that many songs on piano, but I've always
                    enjoyed coming up with original material. This stems from discovering new chords and combinations on
                    the piano since an early age and developing that theoretical knowledge through trial and error.
                    Anyway, it's helped me as a session musician, but with so much material I've recorded and haven't
                    released, I figured doing some music for video games would be a really nice outlet. I also really
                    like video games.”
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What is your creative process? How do you get the ‘musical juices’ flowing?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“Play piano. I've found this to be incredibly important in helping me come up with ideas,
                    especially since I'm spending a lot more hours sitting at a computer than I'm used to. Whenever I
                    have “writers block” it's normally because I haven't jammed for a few hours on the keys like I
                    normally do.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What is a random fact about you?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“Yumface is my favourite emoji and it's more or less the only one I use.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>How does making music for a game differ from making it for a general audience?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“It doesn't differ all too much asides from maybe you prioritise the music fitting in with the
                    game over how somebody might perceive it if they were listening just for leisure. In saying that the
                    video game is hopefully being made for a general audience too, so their enjoyment of the music is
                    still very important to me.”</p>
