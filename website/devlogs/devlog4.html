                <h2>Weekly Updates Week 4: Discover the world of Raum
                </h2>
                <p>The game of Yami takes place within the planet Raum, known for its harsh climates and immense gravity
                    upon its surface. Raum has four moons, and orbits two suns at the center of its solar system. Below
                    is a brief description of each of the heavenly bodies players will spot in the sky during their
                    gameplay, as well as concept art produced by Tumultuous Productions’ talented artists! </p>
                <h3>Moons:</h3>
                <p>Shattered Twins: Two smaller moons within the Raum sky, encircle one another in their own
                    gravitational pull. Debris and rocky dust swirl around both moons as they rotate around one another.
                    Some of the smaller dust and debris have begun to form a faint ring around the moons. </p>
                <p>The Eye of Rage: The surface of this larger moon is covered completely with oxidized iron, giving it
                    a reddened appearance to the inhabitants of Raum. This moon has an asynchronous cycle with the Eye
                    of Mourning, with one day a year the two ‘Eyes are Open’ and one day a year when the two ‘Eyes are
                    Closed.’ These two days were considered sacred to the ancients, and signified important events. When
                    the Eye of Rage is full in the sky, it is considered an omen for danger or violence.</p>
                <p>The Eye of Mourning: The surface of this moon is covered with vast oceans and two polar ice caps,
                    giving it an impression of a teary eye in the sky. This moon has an asynchronous cycle with the Eye
                    of Rage, as aforementioned. When this moon is full in the night sky, it is considered an omen for
                    great sadness or loss. </p>
                <h3>Suns:</h3>
                <p>The two suns of this planet are part of a binary star system, where the two orbit around one another
                    due to their intense gravitational pull. There is a ‘thread’ between the two in the sky, as one star
                    is slowly absorbing energy from the other.
                </p>
                <p>Dorhen: The larger of the two suns, a Class O Blue Giant Star, giving it a large and blue appearance
                    in the day sky.</p>
                <p>Ettas: The smaller of the two suns, a White Dwarf star, which has a luminous white light in the sky,
                    but provides little heat to the surface of Raum.</p>

                <h3>Saving and Loading your game in Yami</h3>
                <p>Within the game of Yami, there will be various locations where the player will be able to save their
                    game. When returning to your journey, you will be able to load your game from multiple save slots.
                    Below are our concept designs for loading screens and save files.

                <h2>Weekly Member Spotlight:</h2>
                <p>For this week, I asked one of our hard-working and incredibly talented coders, ‘SeikLuceid’, a few
                    questions about how they got into coding, and what their creative process looks like. &nbsp;</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What is the process for coding a video game?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“I could go on for days on this subject, game engines, and psuedo-code, both of which are
                    good tips: but what it all comes down to? &nbsp;Breaking your goals up into their smallest parts,
                    smaller
                    than you might be able to consider them as even a 'part' of the goal if possible, then figuring out
                    how to
                    make those pieces work towards your end goal. &nbsp;Psuedo-code is a great tool, Adaptability is
                    important,
                    but functionality is your main goal, especially starting out. &nbsp;If it works, it can be refined.
                    Personally, I use Pseudocode, then I use in-game prompts or debug lines, then I fill them in one at
                    a time,
                    piece by piece, until I get the functionality I need. &nbsp;Afterwards: I begin worrying about
                    cleaning it
                    up, optimizing it, and refactoring it into adaptable, and readable code. &nbsp;</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What made you interested in making a video game?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“As with most game enthusiasts, playing games as a child. &nbsp;I spent a lot of time
                    playing games, indulging in the stories and enthusiasm that surrounded games. &nbsp;Unlike the
                    modern days,
                    games were a secret hobby you did by yourself, when no one was around when I was young. &nbsp; Games
                    didn't
                    even really have a multiplayer. &nbsp;Arcades were still a thing, if that helps to place it for you.
                    &nbsp;By the time it became socially acceptable to play games, was about the time I got my first
                    computer,
                    and really started exploring the wide world of gaming. Sharing stories with a vast audience, and
                    entertaining children who perhaps spend much of their time alone, within their own head, as I did.
                    &nbsp;That's ultimately what my game development is fueled by.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What do you like best about the Yami team?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“The Yami team really stands out to me solely based upon the fact that there is such a
                    constant flow of communication. &nbsp;I've worked on a few teams before, even been part of the
                    problem in
                    them, in which you inevitably had to talk through a chain sequence of people to get clarification or
                    instruction. &nbsp;Personally, I'm glad to be a part of a decent environment, where I feel as if
                    forward
                    progress is being made. &nbsp;You'd think with more people that would be evident, but it's really
                    not.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>Tell us briefly about yourself!</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“I'm really not an about me type of person, honestly, ask anyone who knows me, they learned
                    'about me' by being around me for years, and still learn the most basic things sometimes years down
                    the
                    road. &nbsp;In terms of game development though, I've worked on five separate projects, have two
                    ongoing,
                    participated in one game jam, am participating in a second currently, and have been pursuing this
                    field off
                    and on for years. I have a wall of sticky notes with game design notes on them from my many
                    projects, I
                    can't throw them away because I'm never sure if they'll come up again later. &nbsp;I have a
                    whiteboard, but
                    I never erase it, so it's basically one big sticky note now itself. &nbsp;I love RPGs, I have
                    fancied myself
                    a writer, to about the same degree of success as a game developer, which means none so far! &nbsp;I
                    am
                    horrible at art, practicing, but it's nigh fruitless thus far, hopefully that changes over time!
                    &nbsp;That's about all there is to know about me, at least that I am able to think of!”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What is something about coding that most people don’t know or understand?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“Programming is not a difficult skill. &nbsp;It 'seems' difficult because of the syntax,
                    because of higher level programmers min-maxing their code to be as efficient or as minimal as
                    possible, but
                    code can be as large as it takes to accomplish what you need. &nbsp;The act of programming is not
                    hard, but
                    it is a skill that you gradually improve at. &nbsp;I'm still a novice, my code is probably ugly and
                    unclear
                    as it gets, when it's just for me especially, but it'll function as I intended. &nbsp;There are
                    certainly
                    better ways to accomplish what I have, there are likely more 'adaptable' ways to do it as well, but
                    it's
                    functional. &nbsp;That's where programming begins. &nbsp;Once you can accomplish everything you can
                    think to
                    do in code, then you can expand upon those ideas, try fitting them in similar but not the same
                    situations,
                    update the code to see how you can morph it to work differently, but without destroying how it
                    worked
                    before. &nbsp;Clean it up, make it easy to read, make it easy to follow along with. &nbsp;Many bugs
                    will
                    make you just read through your code, following the logical path, trying to figure out where the
                    issue could
                    be: So if you are having trouble doing that, your code could use some maintenance!”</p>
