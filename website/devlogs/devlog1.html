                <h2>Weekly Updates: Week 1
                </h2>
                <h3>Our Game</h3>
                <p>Yami is a 2D puzzle-platformer/metroidvania style game, using pixel art to send the player into a
                    different world. The story the player experiences is based on a bond between brothers, taking on an
                    ancient, corrupted evil that threatens their way of life. The brothers discover their own strengths
                    as they overcome obstacles, learning that the corruption from the world can oftentimes come from
                    within. As the players control the brothers, they gain skills and power-ups to aid them in their
                    journey, having to solve environmental puzzles and defeat challenging enemies to advance in their
                    quest. </p>
                <h3>Concept Art</h3>
                <p>Here are some examples of the talented concepts and artwork from the artists in Tumultuous Studios.
                    Not all artwork is finalized for in-game, but many ideas and designs will be incorporated into the
                    Yami project.</p>

                <h3>Get to know Yuyo and Yuki</h3>
                <p>When the player(s) begin their journey into the world of Yami, they will soon meet the two main
                    characters of the game, Yuyo and Yuki. It is through these two brothers that the players will travel
                    through the world of Raum, where the titular ‘Yami’ is a form of magic the brothers use to solve
                    puzzles and defeat enemies and monsters.</p>
                <p>The younger brother, Yuyo, has a dark blue skin tone. Yuyo is shorter than his brother, as well as
                    slightly overweight. He can oftentimes become clumsy and is always full of energy and excitement.
                </p>
                <p>The older brother, Yuki, has pinkish-purple skin, with the wispy flames atop his head slicked back
                    further than his younger brother. He is taller and thinner than Yuyo, and tries to act more
                    respectful and dignified, knowing that he will be carrying on the Yami magic for the family. He does
                    however, enjoy teasing his brother and playing harmless tricks on him, although he chides Yuyo in
                    public to remain respectful to others.</p>
                <h3>Creatures within Kinfallen Forest</h3>
                <p>The first area the brothers will journey into, Kinfallen Forest, is an ancient grove and burial
                    ground of the fallen warriors from the days of the Empire. It is here that Yuyo and Yuki are faced
                    with their first real challenges, with their lives on the line should they fail. Within this forest
                    the dead do not rise, but living creatures above the fallen have laid claim to the forest. And they
                    do not allow interlopers to wander into their domain without punishment. Below are two of the main
                    enemies the players will encounter as they make their way through Kinfallen Forest:</p>
                <p>Shrubble: A small plant-like creature inhabiting the forest floor.</p>
                <p>Tresswing: This aerial creature which flies amongst the canopy of the forest. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="starred">*Concept art for first two enemies will be in next week’s Dev-Log with more to follow
                    each week.</p>
