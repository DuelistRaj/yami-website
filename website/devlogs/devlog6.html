                </h2>
                <p><span>In our first DevLog, we spoke briefly of Yuki and Yuyo and their journey they would face within
                        the game Yami. Our concept artists and pixel artists have been hard at work to fine-tune the
                        design and movements of our characters, in order to obtain the best experience for players and
                        streamline gameplay. Pictured below are some of our more current designs for Yuyo and Yuki.
                        (Images may be altered prior to release). Yuki is the elder brother and has a purple skin tone,
                        whereas Yuyo has a blue skin tone. </span></p>

                <h2><span>Menu Screen Music:</span></h2>
                <p><span>Our lead composer, Sassykeys, has been working diligently for the past few months to develop an
                        amazing soundtrack for the Yami game, which incorporates enchanting melodies while also
                        immersing the player into the world of Yuyo and Yuki. Below are links to samples of the music
                        for the Yami Menu Screen, which a player will see upon loading up the game. </span></p>
                <p><span>Stay tuned for more musical updates in the DevLogs to follow!</span></p>

                <h2><span>Weekly Member Spotlight:</span></h2>
                <p><span>Our Art-Lead _D_ was kind enough to answer a few interview questions this week. Despite being a
                        part of ‘Tumultuous,’ _D_ is anything but, producing incredible content and possessing an
                        organized and level-headed managerial process for our Art Team. Below is our Q&amp;A and _D_ 's
                        responses. </span></p>
                <p><span>Q</span><span>: When did you first start doing art?</span></p>
                <p><span>A</span><span>: “I've been doodling and/or drawing since I could stand pretty much. My mother
                        was a school teacher and would take me to school with her when I was very young and I would draw
                        these massive dinosaur murals on the chalkboards.”</span></p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <p><span>Q</span><span>: How is doing art for a video game similar or different to conventional
                        artwork?</span></p>
                <p><span>A</span><span>: “I think the biggest difference is keeping in mind both the underlying style
                        and lore of the subject matter and more importantly, one’s ability as an artist to create
                        hundreds if not thousands of assets for a single title. When I'm creating for myself I need not
                        worry outside of the piece being something that I want to do and feels right.”</span></p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <p><span>Q</span><span>: What is your creative process when drawing? What are the steps in your mind and
                        thought process?</span></p>
                <p><span>A</span><span>: “Firstly, I try to really understand my subject. What is it made of, how does
                        it exist in our world, what properties does it have and how do I need to render it. My first
                        sketches are very raw and focused on roughing in the general shapes of the object. After that I
                        fill in details that need to be accurate, such as eyes or a nose, if these look right then the
                        rest will usually follow easily. Fine details come last and are less important in rendering the
                        object convincingly.”</span></p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <p><span>Q</span><span>: Tell us a bit about yourself!</span></p>
                <p><span>A</span><span>: “I'm a full time professional graphic designer with a fortune 100 company where
                        I have worked for over 13 years. I'm happily married (also 13 years), no kids but I do have two
                        cats which are treated as such. &nbsp;I love video games, sci-fi, heavy metal music. I cook and
                        enjoy working in the yard. I wish someday to own a bed and breakfast or possibly my own farm,
                        that is until they start selling space ships.”</span></p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <p><span>Q</span><span>: What are some tips or advice you would give to someone wanting to become an
                        artist for a video game?</span></p>
                <p><span>A</span><span>: “Ha! me give advice, I came here looking for advice. I suppose it is like
                        anything in life; if you want to do it just go out and do it. Luckily for games you don't even
                        need a class, money or even much experience. Go online, look for a team that needs help and
                        volunteer. The worst that could happen is you get feedback about how to improve. We are all
                        constantly improving so every criticism can be a path to becoming better than you were before
                        it. Any time something seems hard to do, you are on the right track. If you start drawing things
                        you think are cool, others will as well.”</span></p>
