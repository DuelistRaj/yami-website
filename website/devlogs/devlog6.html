                <h2>Weekly Updates Week 6:&nbsp;A brother of purity, a brother of corruption
                </h2>
                <p>In our first DevLog, we spoke briefly of Yuki and Yuyo and their journey they would face within
                    the game Yami. Our concept artists and pixel artists have been hard at work to fine-tune the
                    design and movements of our characters, in order to obtain the best experience for players and
                    streamline gameplay. Pictured below are some of our more current designs for Yuyo and Yuki.
                    (Images may be altered prior to release). Yuki is the elder brother and has a purple skin tone,
                    whereas Yuyo has a blue skin tone. </p>

                <h3>Menu Screen Music:</h3>
                <p>Our lead composer, Sassykeys, has been working diligently for the past few months to develop an
                    amazing soundtrack for the Yami game, which incorporates enchanting melodies while also
                    immersing the player into the world of Yuyo and Yuki. Below are links to samples of the music
                    for the Yami Menu Screen, which a player will see upon loading up the game. </p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more musical updates in the DevLogs to follow!</p>

                <h3>Weekly Member Spotlight:</h3>
                <p>Our Art-Lead _D_ was kind enough to answer a few interview questions this week. Despite being a
                    part of ‘Tumultuous,’ _D_ is anything but, producing incredible content and possessing an
                    organized and level-headed managerial process for our Art Team. Below is our Q&amp;A and _D_ 's
                    responses. </p>
                <p>Q: When did you first start doing art?</p>
                <p>A: “I've been doodling and/or drawing since I could stand pretty much. My mother
                    was a school teacher and would take me to school with her when I was very young and I would draw
                    these massive dinosaur murals on the chalkboards.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Q: How is doing art for a video game similar or different to conventional
                    artwork?</p>
                <p>A: “I think the biggest difference is keeping in mind both the underlying style
                    and lore of the subject matter and more importantly, one’s ability as an artist to create
                    hundreds if not thousands of assets for a single title. When I'm creating for myself I need not
                    worry outside of the piece being something that I want to do and feels right.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Q: What is your creative process when drawing? What are the steps in your mind and
                    thought process?</p>
                <p>A: “Firstly, I try to really understand my subject. What is it made of, how does
                    it exist in our world, what properties does it have and how do I need to render it. My first
                    sketches are very raw and focused on roughing in the general shapes of the object. After that I
                    fill in details that need to be accurate, such as eyes or a nose, if these look right then the
                    rest will usually follow easily. Fine details come last and are less important in rendering the
                    object convincingly.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Q: Tell us a bit about yourself!</p>
                <p>A: “I'm a full time professional graphic designer with a fortune 100 company where
                    I have worked for over 13 years. I'm happily married (also 13 years), no kids but I do have two
                    cats which are treated as such. &nbsp;I love video games, sci-fi, heavy metal music. I cook and
                    enjoy working in the yard. I wish someday to own a bed and breakfast or possibly my own farm,
                    that is until they start selling space ships.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Q: What are some tips or advice you would give to someone wanting to become an
                    artist for a video game?</p>
                <p>A: “Ha! me give advice, I came here looking for advice. I suppose it is like
                    anything in life; if you want to do it just go out and do it. Luckily for games you don't even
                    need a class, money or even much experience. Go online, look for a team that needs help and
                    volunteer. The worst that could happen is you get feedback about how to improve. We are all
                    constantly improving so every criticism can be a path to becoming better than you were before
                    it. Any time something seems hard to do, you are on the right track. If you start drawing things
                    you think are cool, others will as well.”</p>
