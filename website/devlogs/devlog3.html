                <h2>Weekly Updates Week 3: More Creatures within Kinfallen Forest
                </h2>
                <p>Here is a showcase of two more enemies you will encounter in the Kinfallen Forest, including a brief
                    description and concept art created by our talented artists:</p>
                <p>Scavenger: Thought by some to be corrupted descendants of those lost within Kinfallen Forest, the
                    scavenger hunts for trinkets and valuables scattered along the undergrowth of the forest. It carries
                    its belongings in an overstuffed satchel upon its back, clinging to the past memories these items
                    possess. When spotted, they will back away and only attack when threatened, but will become
                    emboldened when other members of its kind are nearby.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Uprooter: A subterranean creature of the forest, the uprooter dwells mainly within the vast root
                    system of Kinfallen Forest, digging burrows and creating mounds of soil. Its nose resembles a forest
                    flower, tricking passersby into a sense of security. When a traveler encroaches on its territory, it
                    will jump out of the ground and attack with its powerful claws, sometimes throwing mounds of dirt
                    and rock in defense. </p>

                <h3>Weekly Member Spotlight:</h3>
                <p>This week, I metaphorically ‘sat down’ with Arabesco, one of our artists on the team and an
                    incredibly talented pixel-art animator. I asked her about her process and working style to produce
                    such amazing animations for Yami. Thanks again to Arabesco for answering our questions!</p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What is your artistic background?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>"I began my journey into art very early on - I was around 2 when my cousin drew a cat on paper.
                    Enchanted by the idea of creating something in paper, I decided to learn how to draw. Eventually I
                    began to draw digitally as well and thus became fascinated with the idea of making artwork for a
                    game. For now I am doing Visual Arts as a major in college and will possibly get a minor in graphic
                    design.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>How did you get inspired to make art for a video game?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“When I was 14 or so, I found out that people could make their own games relatively easily and
                    publish them in the internet. The catch was that you needed to make your art yourself. I did not
                    know about sites that let you use their material for free. So I decided to do game art and thus live
                    and learn, reading pixel art articles and whatnot as well as staring at spritesheets while figuring
                    out how do The Experts do it.”
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>How do you animate your art?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“When it comes to pixel art, I use an approach that to an extent is similar to
                    rigging/puppeteering: putting the moving parts in their layers and moving them with edits to
                    maintain consistency. This allows for a faster workflow. Outside of it I tend to do hand drawn
                    animations in krita.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>Tell us briefly about yourself!</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“I am an individual. Living in some south american country, close to the sea, I often either work
                    on the many things I have or just stand there. Menacingly.”</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What is your process for making art?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>“I first have an idea. Then I try to think of the many ways to approach said idea. Then I
                    materialize the concept. Once I feel it is satisfactory, I put it out.”</p>
