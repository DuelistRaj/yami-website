                <h3>Forgotten Defender
                </h3>
                <p>As Yuyo and Yuki’s ancestors fled the fallen Empire, evil was always one step behind. When they
                    finally arrived at what is now Kinfallen Forest, there they found themselves surrounded by dangerous
                    creatures and former citizens of the Empire now tainted and corrupted. One alone of the survivors
                    was strong enough to take on these foes while also allowing the others to escape to safety beyond.
                    She had been part of General Stonefast’s elite squad of soldiers, and her powerful and pure Yami
                    magic held the evil at bay, and sealed away Malflessia, the root of all evil within the forest. But
                    as always happens with time, the memory of this champion was eventually lost, yet the Forgotten
                    Defender remains a constant presence. Until she is unable to hold back Malflessia any longer. </p>

                <h3>NPC: The Lingering Nomad</h3>
                <p>While the brothers Yuyo and Yuki journey through Kinfallen Forest, the first major area of Yami, they
                    will encounter the Lingering Nomad. A powerful magic user from the brothers’ hometown, he once
                    journeyed across the old Empire on a personal quest. He did not find what he sought, however, and
                    now lingers on at the edge of the forest, unable to return home yet unable to travel any longer. He
                    possesses knowledge of how to use magic and attune spells, and gives the brothers precious
                    teachings, should they accept to learn. </p>

                <h2>Weekly Member Spotlight:</h2>
                <p>One of our hard-working Project Leads and Team Lead for our coders, Marcel, was gracious enough to
                    answer a
                    few questions this week about his process and about himself. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What do you think makes a good video game?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>I think a good video game is a game who you can play with your friends, is challenging with
                    lots of puzzles and can make you laugh. Portal2 is such game that i always liked to play. The
                    important
                    parts of a video game are the assets and gameplay. If one of the music, sprites/models or game
                    mechanics
                    isn't done properly, you will probably lose the attention and interest of your players very quickly.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What would you say is the hardest part of coding?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>The hardest part of coding for me is probably using the unknown. How do you design complex
                    systems without even knowing what is possible. So using the Unity engine is very challenging for me,
                    as this
                    is a big engine with lots of options. I have worked with Unity before, but that was during my
                    studies, and
                    not on a professional scale as we use now.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>Do you think 2D pixel art games are a ‘fad’ or now have a place as a genre of games?
                </p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>2D is definitely not a 'fad'. I played 2D pixel games when I was young, and i still play
                    those games. 2D games belong to my favorites and will continue to exist for the time being. This is
                    probably
                    due to their simplicity. 2D games are (mostly) easy to play and you can have tons of fun with them.
                    It has
                    always been a dream of me to build such games. So to have the opportunity to work on this project is
                    amazing.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>Tell us a bit about yourself!</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>I'm 29 years young and living in the Netherlands. Currently working for an IT company
                    carrying the title 'System Designer'. During my work I use programming languages such as Java and
                    TypeScript. But i also have a lot of knowledge of MySQL, Html, CSS, Framework such as Angular,
                    Dropwizard
                    and Hibernate. I have worked with SVN and Git as version management systems. Beside my work and
                    programming
                    hobbies I also like to work with my hands. So that means I do a lot of jobs around the house (that
                    also
                    makes my girlfriend very happy). Beside working all the time I also like to travel. My girlfriend is
                    from
                    one of the Caribbean islands, so we visit their family there once in a while. We also travel a lot
                    around
                    the world. I have been to Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Central and East Australia, New
                    Zealand,
                    South Africa, and to the United States (with a touch of Canada). And of course we also explored
                    quite some
                    places in Europe as well.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span class="question">Q: </span>What was your funniest moment while coding?</p>
                <p><span class="answer">A: </span>My funniest moment. That's hard, but probably that time that I looked back at some code
                    that I wrote before I even studied to be a programmer. I wrote some script that could be used in a
                    game
                    called Blockland. When I looked at that I realized that I copied the code 10 times in the same
                    method to get
                    things to work. So badly written, but it still did the job :). Nowadays I'm all about efficiency and
                    simplistic code. So if you hear any of the programmers whining about making changes to a pull
                    request before
                    it will get approved, it is probably because I'm the one reviewing it.</p>
